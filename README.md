# EEG-Drowsiness-Detection-for-Drivers
This project uses EEG data from the NeuroSky MindWave sensor to detect drowsiness in drivers by analyzing brainwave frequencies. The model classifies states as "sleepy" or "not sleepy" and explores real-world applications in autonomous vehicles and wearable devices for driver safety.
